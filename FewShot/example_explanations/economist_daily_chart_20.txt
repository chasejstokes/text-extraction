This image contains two charts. On the left, it contains a line chart entitled East Asia and Pacific. On the right, it contains a line chart entitled Sub-Saharan Africa. Because the top and bottom of the charts are aligned, there is only one row of charts, so they both have rows (0,0). Because there are two charts side by side, we have two columns. The East Asia and Pacific line chart on the left occupies column (0,0) because it is on the left, and the Sub-Saharan Africa line chart on the right ocupies columns (1,1), because it is directly to the right of the first chart.
