This image contains four charts. In the top left corner, there is a bar chart on the Population, 2011, %. In the bottom left corner, there is a bar chart on the subject of Poll ratings. On the top right, there is a table entitled Households. On the bottom right, there is a map entitled Presidential election voting. Because the edges of the charts do not line up, the overlay for this image has a new row start at the top of each chart, and a new column start at the left of each chart. Therefore, the Population bar chart spans rows (0,1) because it spans from the top of the Population bar chart, and the top of the map, and ends at the top of the Poll ratings bar chart. The population bar chart only spans one column, so its column value is (0,0). The Poll Ratings bar chart is below the population bar chart, so its first row is one more than the last row that the population bar chart occupies, and it only spans one row, so its row is (2,2). The poll ratings bar chart also only spans one column. The households table's bottom is the first chart to end, so its row is (0,0). Its columns are (1,1) becuase it is in the left half of the image. The map is directly under the table, and spans to the end of the image, so it occupies rows (1,2). It also only occupies column (1,1).
