This image contains two charts. On the left, it contains a circle chart entitled "% of households who:". On the right, it contains a line chart entitled "% of population not paying income tax". Because the top and bottom of the charts are aligned, there is only one row of charts, so they both have rows (0,0). Because there are two charts side by side, we have two columns. The circle chart on the left occupies column (0,0) because it is on the left, and the line chart on the right ocupies columns (1,1), because it is directly to the right of the first chart.
