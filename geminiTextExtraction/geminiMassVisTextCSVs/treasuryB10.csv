"* Treasury currently has a net investment of $151b in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which is expected to be reduced over time as those firms generate positive earnings. OMB projects the eventual cost to fall to $28b by fiscal year 2022. This estimate however could change materially depending on future changes in home prices, enterprise market share, and other operating assumptions.",annotation,L4
"** Treasury estimates. Based on the President’s FY2013 Budget, the Federal Reserve has already remitted $82 billion in excess earnings – above what would be expected in normal times – to the Treasury through fiscal year 2011. Total excess earnings from the Federal Reserve to be remitted to the general fund are currently forecast to reach $179 billion through fiscal year 2015. The amount of future Federal Reserve earnings is uncertain and will depend on future financial, economic, and market conditions.",annotation,L4
