THE BIG CLEAN-UP,title,L1
"In March 2009 the Mexican government published a list of its 37 most-wanted suspected drug traffickers. Since then, 25 kingpins have fallen, either arrested or killed by government forces, or rubbed out by their competitors. For a long time, bringing down villains seemed to do little to stem the violence, but over the past year the murder rate has been falling for the first time in 5 years. The following gallery shows the alleged bandits who have been apprehended, along with those who remain at large.",caption,L4
